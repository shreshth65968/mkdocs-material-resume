I'm really into writing and |explaining technical stuff in a way that's easy to understand.  Outside of classes, I volunteer with a group that uses tech to make a positive impact on society. It's cool to see how we can use what we know to help others.  I'm always learning and looking for ways to use my skills to make a difference. I'm excited to see where this journey takes me and how I can keep making the world a better place with tech.</p> \ud83c\udf93 Educational Background  <p>COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING ROORKEE UNIVERSITY (September 2022 - November 2026)</p> <ul> <li><p>B.tech-Computer Science Engineering | Majors - Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning</p>  \ud83d\udcbc Volunteer &amp; Experience <p>Volunteer ((Datakind) - September 2023 - September 2023) <ul> <li><p>Worked with 300 Volunteers in project Gender, in data dive event, got exposure to working with big datasets provided.
